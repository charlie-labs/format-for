    # Rely on the repository's default branch (avoid hard-coding "master"/"main")

  # NOTE: We intentionally do not enable the npm ecosystem here because this repo
  # uses Bun with a Bun lockfile (bun.lock). As of today, Dependabot does not
  # update Bun lockfiles, and our CI uses `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, which
  # would cause npm PRs to fail. If/when Dependabot adds Bun lockfile support,
  # we can add an "npm" entry below or switch to Renovate for runtime deps.
